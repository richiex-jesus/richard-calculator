my calculator project....this is the final project in the TOP Foundations course before I begin JavaScript Fullstack. Praise the Lord for allowing me to do this wonderful work!


pseudocode:
make the HTML page for the calculator (done).
add an event-istener to each number button (9-0) such that it listens to the 'click' event.
